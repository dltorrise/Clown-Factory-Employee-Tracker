## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to tutor Matthew Calimbas for introducing me to the console.table dependency which nicely formats the output tables in SQL. 
  
Thank you also to my classmate Adam [(GitHub linked here)](https://github.com/Variegatedhuman) who helped debug my schema.sql (it was a comma throwing the error).
